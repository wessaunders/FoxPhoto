Conversation Context & Summary
This document provides a summary of our ongoing collaboration on the FoxPhoto desktop application, capturing our progress and the key solutions we've found.
1. Application OverviewObjective: Develop a cross-platform desktop application using Electron, React, and Mantine to browse local file systems and view images.
Key Technologies:Frontend: React, Mantine, Zustand (for state management)
Backend: Electron (for file system access via IPC)
Core Components: App.jsx, main.jsx, store.js, FileExplorer.jsx, ThumbnailGrid.jsx, FullImageView.jsx, Slideshow.jsx, SlideshowControls.jsx.
2. Features Implemented & Resolved Issues
We have successfully implemented the following core features:
File System Navigation: The application can read root directories and navigate through folders.
Thumbnail Grid: Images are displayed in a responsive thumbnail grid.
Full Image View: Clicking a thumbnail opens a full-screen view with next/previous navigation.
Light/Dark Mode: The theme can now be toggled correctly using Mantine's built-in useMantineColorScheme hook.
Slideshow: A new slideshow feature has been added. It can display selected images or all images in the current folder, and it includes user-configurable delay and a "fade" effect.
Starting Folder: The application now has the ability to set a specific folder as the starting point. This functionality is handled by a startingPath state variable in the Zustand store and a new button in App.jsx. The application now checks for this startingPath on initial load.
3. Recent Progress & Debugging
Our most recent work has focused on adding the starting folder feature. The implementation is complete, and the application now correctly loads a designated starting folder on startup.
4. Next Steps
The application is in a very robust state. What would you like to work on next? Perhaps we could add the ability to persist the starting folder and slideshow settings between sessions, or maybe implement a search function to find images in the current directory?
