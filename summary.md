Conversation Context & Summary
This document provides a summary of our ongoing collaboration on the FoxPhoto desktop application, capturing our progress and the key solutions we've found.

1. Application Overview
Objective: Develop a cross-platform desktop application using Electron, React, and Mantine to browse local file systems and view images.
Key Technologies:Frontend: React, Mantine, Zustand (for state management)
Backend: Electron (for file system access via IPC)
Core Components: App.jsx, main.jsx, store.js, FileExplorer.jsx, ThumbnailGrid.jsx, FullImageView.jsx, Slideshow.jsx, SlideshowControls.jsx.

2. Features Implemented & Resolved Issues
We have successfully implemented the following core features:
- File System Navigation: The application can read root directories and navigate through folders.
- Thumbnail Grid: Images are displayed in a responsive thumbnail grid.
- Full Image View: Clicking a thumbnail opens a full-screen view with next/previous navigation.
- Light/Dark Mode: The theme can now be toggled correctly using Mantine's built-in useMantineColorScheme hook.
- Starting Folder: The application has the ability to set a specific folder as the starting point, stored in the Zustand store.
- Slideshow: A slideshow feature has been added with user-configurable delay and two effects ("fade" and "wipe"). The slideshow can display selected images or all images in the current folder.
- Settings Persistence: We implemented the ability to persist the starting folder and slideshow settings between sessions. This required updates to the Zustand store, the React App component, and the Electron main.js and preload.js files to handle file I/O.



3. Recent Progress & Debugging
Our most recent work has focused on implementing a filename search feature. This was accomplished by:
- Updating store.js: We added a new searchTerm state variable and a setSearchTerm action. The readDirectory action was modified to filter images based on the searchTerm.
- Updating App.jsx: We integrated a TextInput component with a search icon (IconSearch) into the header. This input is tied to the searchTerm state, which automatically triggers the filtering logic when the user types.


4. Next Steps
The application is in a very stable and functional state. What would you like to work on next? Perhaps we could implement a search function to find images in the current directory, add more slideshow effects, or create a way to bookmark favorite folders?
