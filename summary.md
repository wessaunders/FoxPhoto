Conversation Context & Summary
This document provides a summary of our ongoing collaboration on the FoxPhoto desktop application, capturing our progress and the key solutions we've found.

1. Application Overview
Objective: Develop a cross-platform desktop application using Electron, React, and Mantine to browse local file systems and view images.
Key Technologies:Frontend: React, Mantine, Zustand (for state management)
Backend: Electron (for file system access via IPC)
Core Components: App.jsx, main.jsx, store.js, FileExplorer.jsx, ThumbnailGrid.jsx, FullImageView.jsx, Slideshow.jsx, SlideshowControls.jsx.

2. Features Implemented & Resolved Issues
We have successfully implemented the following core features:
- File System Navigation: The application can read root directories and navigate through folders.
- Thumbnail Grid: Images are displayed in a responsive thumbnail grid.
- Full Image View: Clicking a thumbnail opens a full-screen view with next/previous navigation.
- Light/Dark Mode: The theme can now be toggled correctly using Mantine's built-in useMantineColorScheme hook.
- Starting Folder: The application has the ability to set a specific folder as the starting point, stored in the Zustand store.
- Slideshow: A slideshow feature has been added with user-configurable delay and two effects ("fade" and "wipe"). The slideshow can display selected images or all images in the current folder.
- Settings Persistence: We implemented the ability to persist the starting folder and slideshow settings between sessions. This required updates to the Zustand store, the React App component, and the Electron main.js and preload.js files to handle file I/O.



3. Recent Progress & Debugging
Our most recent work has focused on implementing a filename search feature. We've now refined this functionality further by:
- Filtering Directories and Images: The search term now filters both image files and subfolders in the current directory, making the search much more powerful.
- Clear Search Button: We added a clear button to the search input field in the header, which allows users to quickly remove the search term and see all files again.
- Code Updates: This was accomplished with updates to the store.js to handle filtering both types of items and the App.jsx to add the clear button logic.



4. Next Steps
The application is in a very stable and functional state. What would you like to work on next? We could refine the search functionality by adding a debounced search to improve performance, add more slideshow effects, or create a way to bookmark favorite folders.
