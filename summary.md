Conversation Context & Summary
This document provides a summary of our ongoing collaboration on the FoxPhoto desktop application, capturing our progress and the key solutions we've found.

1. Application Overview
Objective: Develop a cross-platform desktop application using Electron, React, and Mantine to browse local file systems and view images.
Key Technologies:Frontend: React, Mantine, Zustand (for state management)
Backend: Electron (for file system access via IPC)
Core Components: App.jsx, main.jsx, store.js, FileExplorer.jsx, ThumbnailGrid.jsx, FullImageView.jsx, Slideshow.jsx, SlideshowControls.jsx.

2. Features Implemented & Resolved Issues
We have successfully implemented the following core features:
- Advanced Search: The images can be sorted and ordered by name, date, and resolution
- File System Navigation: The application can read root directories and navigate through folders.
- Thumbnail Grid: Images are displayed in a responsive thumbnail grid.
- Full Image View: Clicking a thumbnail opens a full-screen view with next/previous navigation.
- Light/Dark Mode: The theme can now be toggled correctly using Mantine's built-in useMantineColorScheme hook.
- Starting Folder: The application has the ability to set a specific folder as the starting point, stored in the Zustand store.
- Slideshow: A slideshow feature has been added with user-configurable delay and two effects ("fade" and "wipe"). The slideshow can display selected images or all images in the current folder.
- Settings Persistence: We implemented the ability to persist the starting folder and slideshow settings between sessions. This required updates to the Zustand store, the React App component, and the Electron main.js and preload.js files to handle file I/O.

3. Key Immersive Artifacts
The following code files represent the core components and state management logic for the current version of the application. These are the most up-to-date files we are working with:
- App.jsx: The main application component. It now includes a button to open the AdvancedSearchModal and handles the overall layout.
- AdvancedSearchModal.jsx: A new component that encapsulates the UI for advanced search and sorting options, making the main app cleaner.
- store.js: The central Zustand store file. It now imports and combines the individual state "slices."
- createDirectorySlice.js: Manages directory and image data. This is where the filtering and sorting logic for the advanced search is implemented.
- createSearchSlice.js: Manages the state for both basic and advanced search criteria, including searchTerm and advancedSearch.
- createSettingsSlice.js: Handles the application's settings, such as the starting path and slideshow options.
- createSlideshowSlice.js: Manages the state and logic for the image slideshow feature.

4. Recent Progress & Debugging
Our most recent work has focused on implementing a filename search feature. We've now refined this functionality further by adding:
- Advanced Search Functionality: Users can now filter images by type and a minimum resolution.
- Sorting: The application now supports sorting search results by name, date modified, and resolution in both ascending and descending order.
- Zustand Store Refactoring: The application's state management has been refactored from a monolithic store into separate, more maintainable slices.

5. Next Steps
The application is in a very stable and functional state. What would you like to work on next? We could refine the search functionality by adding a debounced search to improve performance, add more slideshow effects, or create a way to bookmark favorite folders.
