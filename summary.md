Conversation Context & Summary
This document provides a summary of our ongoing collaboration on the FoxPhoto desktop application, capturing our progress and the key solutions we've found.

1. Application Overview
Objective: Develop a cross-platform desktop application using Electron, React, and Mantine to browse local file systems and view images.
Key Technologies:Frontend: React, Mantine, Zustand (for state management)
Backend: Electron (for file system access via IPC)
Core Components: App.jsx, main.jsx, store.js, FileExplorer.jsx, ThumbnailGrid.jsx, FullImageView.jsx, Slideshow.jsx, SlideshowControls.jsx.

2. Features Implemented & Resolved Issues
We have successfully implemented the following core features:
File System Navigation: The application can read root directories and navigate through folders.
Thumbnail Grid: Images are displayed in a responsive thumbnail grid.
Full Image View: Clicking a thumbnail opens a full-screen view with next/previous navigation.
Light/Dark Mode: The theme can now be toggled correctly using Mantine's built-in useMantineColorScheme hook.
Starting Folder: The application has the ability to set a specific folder as the starting point, stored in the Zustand store.
Slideshow: A slideshow feature has been added with user-configurable delay and two effects ("fade" and "wipe"). The slideshow can display selected images or all images in the current folder.


3. Recent Progress & Debugging
Our most recent work has focused on debugging and adding persistence to the application.
- Slideshow Debugging: We resolved an issue where slideshow effects were not working correctly. The solution involved refactoring the Slideshow.jsx component to use a single <img> tag with a dynamic key prop and updating Slideshow.css to use @keyframes for smooth and reliable animations.
- Settings Persistence: We implemented the ability to persist the starting folder and slideshow settings between sessions. This required:
  - Adding saveSettings and loadSettings actions to the store.js.
  - Updating the App.jsx component to load settings on startup.
  - Creating new IPC handlers in the Electron main.js to save and load a settings.json file in the user's data directory.


4. Next Steps
The application is in a very stable and functional state. What would you like to work on next? Perhaps we could implement a search function to find images in the current directory, add more slideshow effects, or create a way to bookmark favorite folders?
