Conversation Context & Summary
This document provides a summary of our ongoing collaboration on the FoxPhoto desktop application, capturing our progress and the key solutions we've found.

1. Application Overview
Objective: Develop a cross-platform desktop application using Electron, React, and Mantine to browse local file systems and view images.
Key Technologies:Frontend: React, Mantine, Zustand (for state management)
Backend: Electron (for file system access via IPC)
Core Components: App.jsx, main.jsx, store.js, FileExplorer.jsx, ThumbnailGrid.jsx, FullImageView.jsx, Slideshow.jsx, SlideshowControls.jsx.

2. Features Implemented & Resolved Issues
We have successfully implemented the following core features:
File System Navigation: The application can read root directories and navigate through folders.
Thumbnail Grid: Images are displayed in a responsive thumbnail grid.
Full Image View: Clicking a thumbnail opens a full-screen view with next/previous navigation.
Light/Dark Mode: The theme can now be toggled correctly using Mantine's built-in useMantineColorScheme hook.
Starting Folder: The application now has the ability to set a specific folder as the starting point. This functionality is handled by a startingPath state variable in the Zustand store and a new button in App.jsx. The application now checks for this startingPath on initial load.
Slideshow: A slideshow feature has been added with user-configurable delay and two effects ("fade" and "wipe"). The slideshow can display selected images or all images in the current folder.


3. Recent Progress & Debugging
Our most recent work has focused on debugging and refining the slideshow effects. The previous approach led to images overlapping or not transitioning correctly. We resolved this by:

Refactoring Slideshow.jsx: The component was simplified to use a single <img> tag. The transition is now triggered by a change in the key prop, which forces a re-render.

Refactoring Slideshow.css: We replaced the complex, concurrent class-based transitions with a more reliable @keyframes animation system. This ensures the fade and wipe effects are smooth and predictable.


4. Next Steps
The application's core functionality and the slideshow feature are now working correctly with multiple effects and a configurable delay. We are in a great position to add more features. What would you like to work on next? Perhaps we could add the ability to persist the starting folder and slideshow settings between sessions, or maybe implement a search function to find images in the current directory?
